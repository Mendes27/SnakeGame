How to Play

Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:

Your objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each piece of food increases your score and the snake's length.

Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following variables in the source code:

Grid Size: Adjust the size of the game board.

Snake Speed: Change the delay between moves to make the game faster or slower.

Colors: Update the color scheme for the snake, food, and background.

For example, in the GameSettings class:
public static final int GRID_SIZE = 20; // Size of each grid cell
public static final int GAME_SPEED = 100; // Delay in milliseconds
public static final Color SNAKE_COLOR = Color.GREEN; // Snake color
public static final Color FOOD_COLOR = Color.RED; // Food color
